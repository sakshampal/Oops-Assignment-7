    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Abstraction:\n",
    "     . Abstraction focuses on representing the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "     .  It allows you to create abstract models or classes that define the properties and methods representing the core features of real-world entities.\n",
    "     . Abstraction provides a simplified and intuitive interface for interacting with objects, without exposing the internal complexities.\n",
    "     . It is achieved through class hierarchies, interfaces, and abstract classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: A \"Shape\" class hierarchy. You can have an abstract base class called \"Shape,\" with common properties like \"color\" \n",
    "    and an abstract method called \"calculateArea.\" The abstract method is declared in the base class but implemented in its derived\n",
    "    classes (e.g., \"Circle,\" \"Rectangle,\" etc.). Each derived class provides its specific implementation of the \"calculateArea\" method, \n",
    "    which is specific to that shape. Users can interact with objects of the derived classes without worrying about the internal implementation details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Encapsulation:\n",
    "   . Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to that unit.\n",
    "   . It promotes the idea of data hiding, where the internal state of an object is protected from direct external access.\n",
    "   . Encapsulation allows for better organization and maintenance of code, as well as the prevention of unauthorized modifications to the internal state.\n",
    "   . It is achieved through the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control the visibility of members within a class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Consider a \"BankAccount\" class that encapsulates the data and methods related to a bank account. \n",
    "    The class may have private variables like \"accountNumber\" and \"balance,\" along with public methods like \"deposit\" and \"withdraw.\" \n",
    "    The private variables are inaccessible from outside the class, ensuring that they can only be accessed and modified through the public methods.\n",
    "    This protects the integrity of the account's data and provides a controlled interface for interacting with the account.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module that provides infrastructure for\n",
    "      defining abstract base classes in Python. An abstract base class (ABC) is a class that cannot be instantiated \n",
    "      and is meant to be subclassed by other classes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    The abc module is used to define abstract base classes and to enforce a certain interface or set of methods that subclasses\n",
    "    must implement. It helps in achieving abstraction and enforcing a common structure among related classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Defining Abstract Base Classes: The abc module provides the ABC class, which is used as a base class for defining abstract\n",
    "    base classes. Subclasses of ABC can be created to define the common interface or behavior that other classes should adhere to.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Enforcing Method Implementation: Abstract base classes can define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator. \n",
    "    These abstract methods must be implemented by any concrete subclass. If a subclass fails to implement any of the abstract methods, \n",
    "    it will raise a TypeError when an attempt is made to instantiate the subclass.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Polymorphism and Interface Enforcement: By defining abstract base classes, you can create a common interface that different subclasses\n",
    "    can implement in their own way. This allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes as long as they adhere to the \n",
    "    common interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Type Checking and Documentation: Abstract base classes can be used to indicate the expected interface of a class. They serve as a form \n",
    "    of documentation, making it clear which methods must be implemented by subclasses. Additionally, tools like type checkers can leverage \n",
    "    abstract base classes to verify that the code adheres to the expected interface.\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 1. Classes and Objects: Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior into objects. \n",
    "        The internal representation and implementation details of the data are hidden from \n",
    "        the outside world. Only the essential properties and methods are exposed.\n",
    "        \n",
    "     2. Access Modifiers: Utilize access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected, to control the visibility and access to class members \n",
    "       (attributes and methods). By marking certain members as private (usually with a leading underscore, e.g., _data), you can restrict direct access\n",
    "        to them from outside the class. This helps in hiding the internal representation and maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "        \n",
    "     3. Encapsulation: Encapsulate related data and methods into a class to create a cohesive unit. This bundles the data and associated behaviors\n",
    "        together, providing a higher level of abstraction. External code interacts with the object through a well-defined interface of public methods,\n",
    "         without needing to know the implementation details.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    4. Getters and Setters: Use getter and setter methods to provide controlled access to the internal data. By defining methods to retrieve \n",
    "     (get) and modify (set) the data, you can add additional logic or validation before allowing access or modification. This ensures that the data\n",
    "     is accessed or modified in a controlled manner, preserving the integrity of the underlying data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.Abstract Base Classes (ABC): Employ the abc module to define abstract base classes and enforce a common interface among related classes. \n",
    "    By defining abstract methods in the abstract base class, you specify the expected behavior that subclasses must implement. This promotes\n",
